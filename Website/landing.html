                            <p>Welcome to the one stop place for build selection. Here is a little background about me. I am a high end gamer, diablo has been a major passion of mine since the release in 96 when I was 6. I have logged probably half my life in diablo, Diablo 2, LOD, and now Diablo 3</p>
                            <p>What is diablo?</p>
